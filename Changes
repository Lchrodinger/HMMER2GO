0.08	10/13/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Add command for search Pfam for terms (called 'pfamsearch'),
  and create a database of HMMs from the search results, optionally.
- Add method to 'mapterms' class to get pfam to GO mapping file 
  automatically, thus avoiding the requirement for a user-supplied
  file.

  option to allow add more domin-finding methods in the future.

  5.10) Perls.

- Fixed bug with not calculating the number of GO terms
  correctly (was underrepresenting the actual count).

- Removed use of UTF-8 characters for generating hash keys.
  - This resulted in speed improvements, and will allow the 
    Perl version requirement to be lowered in a future release.

  mapping GO terms, instead of just testing that there is 
  output.
